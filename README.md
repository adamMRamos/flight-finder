# flight-finder

Per the requirements, this program accepts 3 arguments: a file name, origin city, and destination
example usage:
`java -jar flight_finder.jar input1.csv "New York" Montreal`

output will be either `true`, `false`, or an appropriate error message.

errors that the program accounts for:
* missing arguments
* exceptions thrown while attempting to read the file
